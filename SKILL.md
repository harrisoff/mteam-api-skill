# M-Team API

## How to Use This Skill

This API documentation is split into multiple files for on-demand loading.

**Directory structure:**
```
references/
├── resources/      # 28 resource index files
├── operations/     # 228 operation detail files
└── schemas/        # 28 schema groups, 53 schema files
```

**Navigation flow:**
1. Find the resource you need in the list below
2. Read `references/resources/<resource>.md` to see available operations
3. Read `references/operations/<operation>.md` for full details
4. If an operation references a schema, read `references/schemas/<prefix>/<schema>.md`
